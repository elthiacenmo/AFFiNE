## Method 1: Download and Run Registry Script
 
The easiest and fastest way to fix the CD/DVD drive missing issue is to download and run a ready-made registry script that will modify Windows Registry automatically. You don't need to edit the registry yourself or have any technical skills. Just follow these simple steps:
 
1. Download the registry script from this link: [Download Registry Script to Fix CD/DVD Drive Missing in Windows](https://www.askvg.com/optical-drives-are-not-showing-in-my-computer/) [^2^]
2. Extract the ZIP file and you will get a file named "Vishal\_Gupta\_Fix\_CD\_DVD\_Drive\_Missing.reg".
3. Double-click on the file and click "Yes" when prompted by User Account Control.
4. Click "Yes" again when asked to confirm adding the information to the registry.
5. Restart your computer and check if your CD/DVD drive icon is showing in My Computer window.

This registry script will delete the "UpperFilters" and "LowerFilters" strings in the following registry key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\ 4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318 [^1^] [^2^]. These strings can sometimes cause problems with optical drives. It will also create a new key "Controller0" under HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\atapi [^2^] and set its value "EnumDevice1" to 1. This will enable Windows to detect your optical drives correctly.
 
## Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall DVD/CD-ROM Drivers
 
If the registry script doesn't work for you, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the DVD/CD-ROM drivers manually. This will refresh the drivers and make Windows recognize your optical drives again. Here is how to do it:

1. Press Windows+R keys simultaneously to launch a Run command. Type devmgmt.msc and press Enter. This will open Device Manager.
2. Click on "View" and select "Show hidden devices".
3. Expand the "DVD/CD-ROM drives" and "IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers" items.
4. Right-click on each entry present under both items and select "Uninstall device".
5. Once all have been removed, right-click on any item and select "Scan for hardware changes".
6. The drives will be rediscovered and when the drivers are loaded back, the drives will re-appear in My Computer window.
7. You can also try to restart your computer.

## Method 3: Check Hardware Connections
 
If none of the above methods work for you, you may have a hardware problem with your optical drives or your computer. You should check if the cables are properly connected and if there is any damage or dust on them. You should also check if the power supply is working properly and if there is enough voltage for your optical drives. You may need to open your computer case and
